##User Management Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System
#Overview
This project implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with an intuitive user management dashboard. Built using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, the system offers robust functionality for managing users and roles, allowing administrators to assign, edit, and remove roles and permissions efficiently.

The application is designed with a focus on usability, responsiveness, and local persistence of data, providing an excellent foundation for scalable RBAC solutions.

Key Features
1. User Management
Add Users:
Create new users by filling out a form with their details such as name, email, and assigned role. Input validation ensures data accuracy, such as verifying email format.
Edit Users:
Modify user details seamlessly through a pre-filled form. Update user information, including their role or status (active/inactive).
Delete Users:
Permanently remove users from the system with a simple click on the "Delete" button in the user table.
2. Role Management
Add Roles:
Define roles that encapsulate specific permissions (e.g., Read, Write, Delete) or custom attributes.
Assign Roles:
Assign roles to users during creation or editing, enabling granular access control.
3. Local Persistence
The application leverages localStorage to ensure user and role data is retained even after refreshing the page, offering a seamless user experience.

4. Responsive Design
The UI is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, with forms and tables dynamically adapting to different screen sizes for a consistent experience.

5. Mock API (Optional Enhancement)
The project structure allows for easy integration with real APIs or mock API calls to simulate server interactions for CRUD operations on users and roles.

Technologies Used
React.js: For building the user interface and managing state.
Tailwind CSS: For responsive and clean styling.
localStorage: To store user and role data persistently in the browser.
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/harver2001/RBAC-VRV-Security.git
2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Run the following command in the project directory:

bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Start the Application
Start the development server using:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Usage Guide
Initialize Roles:
Start by creating roles that can be assigned to users.
Add Users:
Use the "Add User" button to open a form for adding new users. Provide a name, email, role, and status.
Edit Users:
Click the "Edit" button next to a user's record in the table to update their details.
Delete Users:
Use the "Delete" button to permanently remove a user.
Role Assignment:
Assign specific roles to users during creation or editing.
Data Persistence:
All modifications (additions, updates, deletions) are automatically saved to localStorage, ensuring data consistency.
Enhancements
To further improve the project, consider adding:

Search and Filter Functionality: Quickly locate users or roles in large datasets.
Dynamic Permissions Management: Allow administrators to define granular permissions for each role.
Integration with APIs: Replace localStorage with real API calls to interact with a backend system.
Audit Logs: Track user activity and changes in the system for enhanced security.
Why This Project?
This project showcases my ability to:

Design and implement dynamic user interfaces: Utilizing React and Tailwind CSS for scalable and responsive UIs.
Manage data effectively: Employing localStorage for persistence and mock APIs for simulation.
Focus on usability and security: Building intuitive interfaces with essential input validation and access controls.
It reflects a practical and efficient approach to solving real-world problems in user and role management, making it an ideal fit for applications in cybersecurity, enterprise tools, and more.
